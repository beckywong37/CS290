For assignment 5, I wanted to refactor my code from assignment 4 to use Flask for implementing server-side functionality. In assignment 4, I only used JavaScript which included the GrandPrix class, creating instances of these grand prixs, and two functions for dealing with onclick events from two buttons, "Show Race Details" and "Show Race Track." When these buttons are clicked, race details and track image are displayed on the screen.

In assignment 5, code has been refactored to use Flask routes ('/', '/get_race_details', '/get_race_track') to handle request from the client side. As part of the refactoring, the organization of my files changed. Images and javascripts are stored in the static folder and the html script is stored in templates. Instead of just using Javascript for event handling, now when a user interacts with the webpage (clicks on buttons), the JavaScript executes. Based on what the user chooses in the dropdown menu, that is passed to Flask as a 'fetch' request, outputed back to the JavaScript, then output (whether that is the race details or track image) is displayed on the webpage.
