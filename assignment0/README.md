List of 5 Websites

1. Spotify - https://open.spotify.com/?
I may be bias because I've been using Spotify for years and am familiar with the layout, but overall I think the layout is good. There are 4 main widgets on the screen. The home and search button are at the top left for easy access, play, forward, back buttons are at the bottom of the screen, saved playlists are at the left side of the screen, and the home page takes up the right half of the screen. For someone unfamiliar with Spotify it can be a bit of information overload. It can be improved by grouping all the suggested music/podcast given in the home page and only showing if you click on the widget. 

2. Amazon - https://www.amazon.com/
The search button at the top middle of the screen is intuitive. The top banner also includes a link to an individual's account, returns and orders, and the shopping cart which allows for easy access to frequent pages. The home page is information overload and not visually appealing. The flashy ad banners in the background look tacky and are distracting. It can be improved by adopting a more modern and sleek UX interface as the current one looks very outdated.

3. Canvas - https://canvas.oregonstate.ed
I really like the design of the canvas page. It is sleek and minimalistic. Starting off, there is a thin banner taking up the left hand side that includes links to account, dashboard, courses, calendar, inbox, resources, and my media. It also includes an icon for each button which adds to the simple and clean look. It utilizes the OSU colors well, orange for the hyperlinks and black for the text. What I like is that the banner stays on the page, even if you click into the links, ie courses or dashboard. It is easy to nagivate. One improvement is to have dark mode since the white background can be very bright, especially at night.

4. Github - https://github.com
I have only used Github once or twice so this is an unbias review coming from somone who is unfamiliar with this website. First, I like that the settings icon is on the top right. It is easy to access and when you click on it, a banner drops down. I actually prefer the dropdown banner as oppose to it taking you to a different page. There is another 3 line button on the top left corner which again provides easy access to home, issues, pull requests, etc. I like that that it is sleek and clean. It is visually appealing, not too much information overload, and easy to navigate. One improvement is having color themes that users can set, similar to Slack.

5. ChatGPT - https://chat.openai.com/
I like how sleek and miminalistic the design of the page is. On the left hand side is a manner that includes a button to start a new chat (nice icon to indicate new chat) and well as previous searches and finally at the bottom left is settings. Then the rest of the screen is taking up by a huge textbox with a search button saying "Message ChatGPT." The black and gray color scheme works well and overall looks modern and clean. One improvement is to hide the previous searches unless I specifically click on it.
